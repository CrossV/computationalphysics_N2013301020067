#Welcome to README

As a junior student :dog: in WuHan University,I write this profile to make a simple trial to know how this Github gets to work.  
And by the way, its an attempt to use *Markdown* to write.

###About Markdown
I prefer to attach a link here. [*Markdown*]:http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/  
Maybe its useful for anyone who watches this paper.

Except for the reasons above, the most importantly, this profile is an introdution about me to be inspected by my **lovely and respectable teacher**.  

hehe![呵呵](http://att.bbs.duowan.com/forum/201311/06/143629blkknmb28og64o8g.jpg)  

In the following,I will give a shoot about me：

> * I have to admit that previously I don't like some programming work like this.However,May be its becoming different.:cat:

> * I am still ***single***.......

> * I urgently need a high grade.Yeah!   In Zukunft möchte Ich in deutscher Universitat studieren.

> * I will give a try to learn this course.
